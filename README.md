### Reasons for building the project :
On a normal day at work, I had to merge a large number of Excel files, each of which was related to the information of trucks in an operational area for a period of one year, about 26 files (each file contained one year of information).
I very quickly decided to write this code and solved the challenge in very less time without wasting much energy and time, then I decided to share the code here.



### How to work and use :
1- Just put the desired Excel files next to the main file of the program.

2- Run the ConcatenatedTables.py file.

3- After execution, a new file called 'Final.xlsx' will appear immediately, which contains all the information.






#### My achievements from this project :
- Practice and improve how to write neat and clean code, write descriptions, use classes, manage errors, work with files, learn to connect VS Code to GitHub and use different commands and...

Learning continues â™¥
